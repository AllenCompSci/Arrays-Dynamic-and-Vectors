/*
Array Assignment, inside this project you will find 4 text files labeled
listPeriod1 - listPeriod4
Choose the Period you are a part of, read in and store the data from each line 
using ifstream, each int is seperated by a space so a just taking them in with
a simple statement like cin >> x; cin >> x; cin >> x. Will be fine.

Each File has 
X number of students and Y number of grades
X and Y are also the first two numbers located in each file. 
Pull those numbers in from the file.
Create a file with the students name, current average, and average with lowest grade dropped. 
You can use Dynamic Arrays, Static Arrays, or Vectors in your solution. You must use the program
to take in information from the files.
