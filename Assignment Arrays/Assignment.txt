Assignment for Feb 16, 201 7

Each student is to define the following terms as they relate to C++/Computer Science.

Key Terms: (The definitions if computers are available need to be as precise as possible)
Arrays, Index, Pointer, Reference, Variable, Persistence(object persistence), ifsteam, ofstream, 
cout, cin, Vector, Stack, Queue, input, output, “new” as in the creation of a dynamic array.

Explain the components of arrays. Use pictures, also make sure you mention physical address location.
Explain the difference in the cin and the ifstream. 
Explain the difference in the cout and ofstream.
Define which is input and which output.

Explain how a file is like a user typing into the command line prompt?

Finally after this, think about the following prompt.
You are a programmer storing data for reuse from a program. Develop functions that allow you to 
save all the relevant information about each of the three “Clients/Users” such that your program 
will save their information to a file, and then you also develop functions to remove that 
information from a file at a later date. Remember you are going to take information from variables 
and store to a file, and then the reverse as well.
The Three Client/Users are :       Student,     Bank Account Holder,    Employee
(Make sure with each of these, you define what fields of information you wish to store about 
each individual element of the three/clients i.e. You need to store all pertinent variables you can think of for each  Client, separately.)
